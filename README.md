# Rohan Katlae's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience in cybersecurity and software development. The portfolio is built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring a modern, responsive design with smooth animations.

### B.Tech CSE Student | Cybersecurity Enthusiast

I build secure, scalable applications that protect digital infrastructureâ€”where cybersecurity meets clean code architecture.

## About Me

I'm a final year Computer Science & Engineering student at IIIT Pune with a strong passion for cybersecurity and cloud technologies. I specialize in building secure microservices, implementing threat detection systems, and developing robust backend solutions. My expertise spans from Spring Boot applications to machine learning-based security systems on AWS. Currently in the top 7% on TryHackMe and Google Cybersecurity certified.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
